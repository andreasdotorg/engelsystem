## Part 1: Guideline for Heaven Management

### 1.1 Before the Event: Setup Tasks

#### Parental Consent System

1. **Prepare consent forms** in German and English containing:
   - Minor's full name and date of birth
   - Event name and dates
   - Permitted activity categories (A, B, or both)
   - Time restriction acknowledgment
   - Guardian emergency contact
   - Guardian signature and date
   - For ages 15-17: Vollzeitschulpflicht status declaration

2. **Establish consent verification workflow**:
   - Designate responsible person(s) for reviewing consent forms
   - Create secure storage for consent documentation
   - Prepare checklist for consent form completeness

3. **Configure Engelsystem** (if technical support available):
   - Ensure user birthdates are collected at registration
   - Flag users under 18 for manual consent verification
   - Consider restricting shift signup for unverified minors

#### Shift and Activity Classification

1. **Review all angel types** with team leads before the event
2. **Assign category classification** (A, B, or C) to each angel type
3. **Document classifications** in a central reference accessible to all heaven staff
4. **Verify shift times** do not violate minor time restrictions

### 1.2 During the Event: Operational Procedures

#### Minor Registration Checklist

When a minor registers for volunteer activities:

- [ ] Verify age from ID or guardian confirmation
- [ ] Collect completed parental consent form
- [ ] For ages 15-17: Confirm Vollzeitschulpflicht status
- [ ] Record permitted activity categories from consent form
- [ ] Explain time restrictions applicable to the minor's age group
- [ ] Provide minor with information about shift signup rules
- [ ] Note any special circumstances (accompanying younger siblings, etc.)

#### Shift Assignment Verification

Before approving any minor for a shift:

- [ ] Consent form on file? → If NO, do not approve
- [ ] Age-appropriate activity category? → If NO, redirect to suitable shift
- [ ] Shift times within permitted hours? → If NO, do not approve
- [ ] Daily hour limit not exceeded? → If exceeding, do not approve
- [ ] Designated adult supervisor assigned? → If NO, arrange supervision

#### Tracking Minor Volunteer Hours

**Daily Hour Tracking Template**:

| Minor Name | Age Category | Date | Shift 1 | Shift 2 | Total Hours | Limit | Status |
|------------|--------------|------|---------|---------|-------------|-------|--------|
| [Name] | 13-14 | [Date] | 10:00-11:30 | — | 1.5 hrs | 2 hrs | OK |
| [Name] | Teen Angel | [Date] | 08:00-12:00 | 14:00-18:00 | 8 hrs | 8 hrs | AT LIMIT |

**Hour Tracking Best Practices**:
- Check cumulative hours before approving additional shifts
- Warn minors approaching their daily limit
- Do not allow "borrowing" hours from the next day
- Night bonus multipliers do not affect legal hour limits

#### Handling Time Restriction Violations

If a minor is found working outside permitted hours:

1. **Immediately** end the minor's participation in the shift
2. **Document** the circumstances (time discovered, who was supervising)
3. **Contact** the guardian if the minor is under 15
4. **Review** how the violation occurred (system gap, manual override, etc.)
5. **Report** to event organizers for policy review

### 1.3 Accompanying Minors Under 13

#### Registration Process

When a guardian wishes to bring a child under 13:

1. **Explain** that the child cannot perform any volunteer work
2. **Verify** the guardian understands supervision requirements
3. **Record** in the system:
   - Child's name and age
   - Guardian's name and angel registration
   - Acknowledgment of supervision responsibility
4. **Issue** child identification (wristband/badge) if available
5. **Note** any special needs (allergies, medical conditions)

#### Guardian Shift Assignment with Accompanying Child

Before assigning a shift to a guardian with accompanying child:

- [ ] Activity is in a child-safe environment?
- [ ] Guardian can maintain visual contact with child?
- [ ] No hazardous equipment in the area?
- [ ] No age-restricted content in the area?
- [ ] Shift is during child-appropriate hours (8:00-20:00)?
- [ ] Activity allows for childcare interruptions?

**Approved Activities for Accompanied Guardians**:
- Info Desk (daytime, family-friendly areas)
- Herald (family-friendly talks/areas)
- Badge Checking (main entrance, daytime)
- Coat Check

**Prohibited Activities for Accompanied Guardians**:
- Bar Service (any)
- Security (any)
- NOC/Technical operations
- Areas with age-restricted content
- Any activity requiring undivided attention
- Any activity during night hours

#### Child Safety Monitoring

Heaven should periodically check on accompanied children:

- Is the child wearing proper identification?
- Is the guardian maintaining appropriate supervision?
- Does the child appear safe and comfortable?
- Are there any concerns that should be addressed?

If concerns arise:
1. Speak privately with the guardian
2. Offer alternatives (different shift, release from shift)
3. If safety is at risk, end the accompanying arrangement immediately

### 1.4 Emergency Procedures

#### Minor-Related Incidents

For any incident involving a minor volunteer or accompanying child:

1. **Ensure immediate safety** of the minor
2. **Contact guardian** (for accompanied children, guardian is present)
3. **Document** the incident thoroughly:
   - Time and location
   - Nature of incident
   - Persons involved
   - Actions taken
4. **Report** to event organizers
5. **Retain** documentation for event records

#### Lost Child Protocol

If an accompanying child becomes separated from their guardian:

1. **Calm the child** and bring to a safe, staffed location (Heaven, Info Desk)
2. **Broadcast** (discreet) to locate the guardian
3. **Do not** release the child to anyone except the registered guardian
4. **If guardian not found** within reasonable time, contact event security/organizers

```

### 2.2 Creating Shifts

#### Shift Time Compliance Checklist

Before publishing shifts, verify:

- [ ] **For Category A shifts** (all minors eligible):
  - Start time is 8:00 or later
  - End time is 18:00 or earlier
  - Shift duration allows for 2-hour minor participation

- [ ] **For Category B shifts** (teen angels eligible):
  - Start time is 6:00 or later
  - End time is 20:00 or earlier
  - Consider that teen angels have 8-hour daily limit

- [ ] **For all shifts with minors**:
  - Adult supervisor is designated
  - Location is appropriate for the activity category

#### Shift Description Best Practices

Include in every shift description:

1. **Clear activity description** - what will the angel actually do?
2. **Physical requirements** - standing, lifting, walking distances
3. **Age category** - prominently displayed (e.g., "[Category A - All Ages 13+]")
4. **Supervisor information** - who to report to
5. **Location details** - where to go, how to find it

**Example Shift Descriptions**:

```
✓ GOOD:
Title: Info Desk Morning [Category A - All Ages 13+]
Time: 10:00 - 12:00
Location: Main Hall Info Desk
Description: Welcome attendees, answer questions about the event,
provide directions. Light standing work, sitting available.
Supervisor: Info Desk Lead (see schedule)
Requirements: Friendly demeanor, basic event knowledge
```

```
✗ BAD:
Title: Info Desk
Time: 10:00 - 12:00
Description: Staff the info desk
```

### 2.3 Mixed-Age Shift Planning

When planning shifts where both minors and adults may participate:

#### Scheduling Strategy

1. **Create minor-compatible time blocks**:
   - Morning: 8:00-12:00 (4 hours, fits within all minor restrictions)
   - Afternoon: 13:00-17:00 (4 hours, fits within all minor restrictions)
   - Avoid shifts that span beyond 18:00 for Category A activities

2. **Designate supervisors** for each shift with potential minor volunteers

3. **Plan for transition periods**:
   - If minors must leave at 18:00, ensure adult coverage for evening
   - Brief incoming adults on ongoing tasks

#### Capacity Planning

Consider that minor volunteers have limited hours:
- 13-14 year olds: Maximum 2 hours/day
- Teen Angels: Maximum 8 hours/day

Plan shift coverage accordingly—do not rely on minors for continuous coverage.

### 2.4 Category C Activities: Documentation

For adult-only activities, document the restriction reason:

| Activity | Category | Restriction Reason |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Bar Service | C | Alcohol handling prohibited for minors |
| Security | C | Conflict potential, mature judgment required |
| NOC | C | Electrical hazards |
| Heavy Logistics | C | Loads exceed 10kg |
| Night Cleaning | C | Prohibited hours (after 20:00) |
| Content Moderation | C | Age-restricted content exposure |

### 2.5 Pre-Event Checklist for Team Leads

## Part 3: Reference Materials

### 3.1 Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: A 16-year-old says they've finished Vollzeitschulpflicht. How do I verify?**
A: Ask for documentation (school certificate showing completion) or confirmation from a guardian. If uncertain, apply the more restrictive child rules (2 hours/day, 8:00-18:00).

**Q: Can a minor work two separate 2-hour shifts with a break in between?**
A: For children (under 15 or still in Vollzeitschulpflicht): NO, the 2-hour limit is the total daily maximum, not per-shift. For teen angels (15-17, post-school): Yes, they can work up to 8 hours total with required rest breaks.

**Q: A parent wants their 12-year-old to help "just a little bit." Is this allowed?**
A: NO. Children under 13 cannot perform any volunteer work, regardless of parental permission or task simplicity. The child may accompany the parent under the accompanying minor provisions but cannot work.

**Q: Can a minor help with setup/teardown before the event officially starts?**
A: Yes, if all restrictions are met (age-appropriate activity, within permitted hours, parental consent, supervision). The rules apply to all volunteer work, not just during official event hours.

**Q: A minor is eager to help and wants to exceed their hour limit. Can we make an exception?**
A: NO. The time limits are legal requirements, not guidelines. Exceeding them exposes CCC to legal liability. Suggest the minor return tomorrow or find other ways to participate (attending talks, workshops, etc.).

**Q: What if a minor lies about their age?**
A: CCC has taken reasonable steps by collecting birthdates and consent forms. If a minor deliberately misrepresents their age, document the discovery and the actual age, immediately apply correct restrictions, and note the incident for records.

**Q: Congress is during school holidays. Does this affect the rules for 15-17 year olds still in school?**
A: YES. During school holidays, school-age teens (15-17, vollzeitschulpflichtig) may work under the expanded adolescent rules: 8 hours/day, 6:00-20:00, Category A and B activities. This is per JArbSchG § 5(4). However, night shifts (after 20:00) remain prohibited.

**Q: A 16-year-old says they already worked 3 weeks at a summer job. Can they still volunteer at Congress?**
A: YES, but carefully. The school holiday exception allows up to 4 weeks total per calendar year. If they worked 3 weeks elsewhere, they have 1 week remaining. Congress is 4 days (Dec 27-30), well within this limit. Ask about prior holiday employment to verify compliance.

**Q: Does the school holiday exception apply to Camp (usually in August)?**
A: It depends on the exact dates and whether the event falls during school holidays in the relevant German state(s). Camp often occurs during summer break for many states, so the exception may apply. Verify against the specific event dates and school holiday calendars.

**Q: A school-age teen wants to work Category B activities at Congress. Is this allowed?**
A: YES, during Congress (school holidays). School-age teens 15-17 may work Category A AND B activities during school holidays per JArbSchG § 5(4). This would NOT be allowed during school term events.

### 3.4 Legal Reference Summary

**Primary Laws**:
- Jugendarbeitsschutzgesetz (JArbSchG) - Youth Labor Protection Act
- Kinderarbeitsschutzverordnung (KindArbSchV) - Child Labor Protection Ordinance

**Key Provisions**:
- JArbSchG § 2: Definitions (Kind = under 15; Jugendlicher = 15-17)
- JArbSchG § 2(3): School-age adolescents treated as children
- JArbSchG § 5(1): General prohibition of child employment
- JArbSchG § 5(3): Time restrictions for children (2 hours/day, 8:00-18:00)
- JArbSchG § 5(4): **School holiday exception** - vollzeitschulpflichtige Jugendliche may work under adolescent rules during school holidays (up to 4 weeks/year)
- KindArbSchV § 2(1) Nr. 5: Exception for non-commercial association events
- JArbSchG § 8: Adolescent working hours (8 hours/day, 40 hours/week)
- JArbSchG § 14: Adolescent permitted hours (6:00-20:00)

**CCC's Legal Basis**:
CCC e.V. qualifies as a "Verein" under KindArbSchV § 2(1) Nr. 5, and Congress/Camp events qualify as "nichtgewerbliche Veranstaltungen." This permits children over 13 to volunteer if activities are "light and suitable for children."
