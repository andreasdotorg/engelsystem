## Key Legal Findings

1. **JArbSchG applies to organized volunteer work** - Engelsystem-coordinated shifts constitute "Beschäftigung" under § 1 Abs. 1 Nr. 3 and do not qualify for the courtesy assistance exception.

2. **KindArbSchV § 2 Nr. 5 permits minor participation** - CCC e.V. as a registered association ("Verein") conducting non-commercial events qualifies for the exception allowing children over 13 to volunteer.

3. **Age-based restrictions apply**:
   - Under 13: No volunteer work permitted
   - 13-14: Max 2 hours/day, 8:00-18:00 only, Category A activities
   - 15-17 (in school): Same as 13-14 during school term; expanded rules during school holidays (see below)
   - 15-17 (post-school): Max 8 hours/day, 6:00-20:00, Category A and B activities

4. **School holiday exception (JArbSchG § 5 Abs. 4)** - During school holidays, volunteers aged 15-17 who are still in school may work under expanded adolescent rules: **8 hours/day, 6:00-20:00, Category A and B activities**. This applies to **Congress** (December 27-30), which falls during school holidays in all German states. The exception permits up to 4 weeks of holiday work per calendar year.

5. **Accompanying minors under 13** may attend with guardian volunteers under specific conditions but cannot perform any volunteer tasks.
