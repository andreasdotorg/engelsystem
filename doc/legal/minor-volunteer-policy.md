## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

This policy establishes the rules governing participation of minors (persons under 18 years of age) as volunteers at Chaos Computer Club e.V. events. The policy ensures compliance with German youth labor protection law while enabling meaningful participation by young community members.

### 1.2 Scope

This policy applies to all CCC events that use Engelsystem for volunteer coordination, including but not limited to the Chaos Communication Congress, Chaos Communication Camp, and regional CCC meetups. The policy covers both active volunteer participation by minors and the presence of minors accompanying guardian volunteers.

### 1.3 Legal Foundation

Organized volunteer work at CCC events constitutes "Beschäftigung" (employment) within the meaning of § 1 Abs. 1 Nr. 3 JArbSchG and does not fall within the exception for occasional courtesy assistance under § 1 Abs. 2 Nr. 1 a) JArbSchG. Accordingly, the Youth Labor Protection Act (Jugendarbeitsschutzgesetz) and the Child Labor Protection Ordinance (Kinderarbeitsschutzverordnung) apply to all volunteer activities. CCC events qualify for the KindArbSchV § 2 Abs. 1 Nr. 5 exception as non-commercial events of a registered association (eingetragener Verein).

## 2. Definitions

### 2.1 Age Categories

For purposes of this policy, the following age categories apply:

| Category | Age Range | Legal Classification |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| Young Child | Under 13 years | Child (Kind) - no volunteer work permitted |
| Junior Angel | 13-14 years | Child (Kind) - restricted volunteer work |
| School-Age Teen | 15-17 years, still in Vollzeitschulpflicht | Treated as Child under JArbSchG § 2(3) |
| Teen Angel | 15-17 years, completed Vollzeitschulpflicht | Adolescent (Jugendlicher) |

The determination of whether a 15-17 year old remains subject to compulsory full-time education (Vollzeitschulpflicht) depends on state law and individual circumstances. When status is uncertain, the more restrictive child rules apply.

### 2.2 Other Definitions

**Guardian**: A person holding legal custody (*Personensorgeberechtigter*) of a minor, typically a parent.

**Accompanying Minor**: A minor under 13 years who is present at the event under the direct supervision of their guardian while the guardian performs volunteer duties, but who does not perform volunteer work themselves.

**Heaven**: The organizational structure responsible for volunteer coordination at CCC events, including Dispatcher, Supporter, and Bureaucrat roles.

**Angel Type**: A category of volunteer activity with defined tasks, requirements, and restrictions.

**Shift**: A defined period of volunteer work at a specific location performing specific tasks.

## 3. General Principles

### 3.1 Minimum Age for Volunteer Work

The minimum age for volunteer work at CCC events is 13 years. Children who have not yet reached 13 years of age may not be assigned shifts or perform volunteer tasks under any circumstances, regardless of parental consent.

### 3.2 Parental Consent Requirement

All minors require documented parental consent before being assigned volunteer shifts. The consent must be provided by a person holding legal custody and must specify the scope of permitted activities.

### 3.3 Suitability Principle

All activities assigned to minors must be "light and suitable for children" (*leicht und für Kinder geeignet*) as required by KindArbSchV § 2 Abs. 1. Activities that pose physical hazards, require mature judgment for safety decisions, or involve exposure to age-inappropriate content are not suitable for minors.

### 3.4 Supervision Requirement

Minors performing volunteer work must be supervised by a designated adult at all times during their shift. The supervising adult is responsible for ensuring compliance with time restrictions and activity limitations.
